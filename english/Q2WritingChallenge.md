## Choice 8

I think some words I would use to desribe myself are *particular, accustomed, pragmatic, polarized, and shy.* I consider myself particular since I think that for me to feel most comfortable I prefer certain types of tools when I work, I am quite particular about types of pens, and I usually like softer materials on clothing. I also find myself preferring specific software to get things done. For these reasons I would also consider myself quite accustomed, I find myself much more distracted when I'm not using what I'm used to, so I tend to often try to use things that I know will last a long time so I can stay productive while working. I also feel that I tend to find myself more confident in my work and can work faster. I would also consider myself quite pragmatic, as I try to solve problems and identify things based on observable characteristics rather than ideas, I would also say that I typically do not prefer for things to be abstracted, and I typically would like to reasearch/test concepts or other things myself.
