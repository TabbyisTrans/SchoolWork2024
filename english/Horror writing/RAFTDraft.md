Yesterday, a small group of three hikers had entered Adirondack park at approximately Noon, however, the Hikers are never reported to have left park grounds, their vehicles still remain on the premises. Park rangers are establishing a search party this morning in search of the missing group. We will continue to follow this story and provide updates as they come.

Anchor: Tonight, continuing coverage on the search for missing hikers in the Adirondack park. Park Rangers Chief states upon questions from the press "investigation from Park Rangers has not led to the discovery of the Hikers thus far, the only thing of note discovered during the initial search were a group of bags packed with gear left on the ground along the forest trail heading towards the mountains, which the rangers believe belonged to the missing hikers" no other evidence has been found with connection to the vanishing, footprints appear to have completely stopped right where the bags have been discovered. Our reporter is on the ground tonight as we follow this case.

Reporter: Thank you, tonight the search here continues for the 3 hikers who appear to have vanished here on the park premises in the forest here behind me. With over 24 hours passing since the group was last seen, country rangers have joined in the search for the hikers as well. No more evidence has been discovered in connection to the disappearance since the park rangers chief's speech this afternoon about the discovery of the backpacks seemingly left behind by the group. The search party thus far has searched within a few mile radius of the backpacks with no discovery of footprints matching those of the hikers. Overall, no new discoveries thus far in the search, the group has almost completely disappeared without a trace!

Anchor: Thank you, on to our next story --

Anchor: This morning comes a shocking twist in the search for the missing hikers in Adirondack Park, after small but noticeable seismic activity within the premises, the Hikers have seemingly re-appeared on the premises in the exact same location they had disappeared at, with no remembrance of anything over the period they were missing, they attempted to leave the park but were taken to the local hospital for checkups, remarkably, none of the group has any injury or effects of malnourishment despite being missing for almost 3 days! We have made contact with the hospital and have arranged for an interview for the nightly news tonight at 7:00!

Reporter: Thank you, tonight I'm here with _____, _____,  and _____, and I think the question on everyone's mind is what happened over the past couple of days? Where have you been?

_____: Honestly I don't even remember, it was like we were walking on a trail together, and then everything went white, and I woke up back in the same place, none of us even knew what happened, and we just headed back like normal and the rangers said they have been looking for us for days! We don't even know what happened!

Reporter: Well you heard it here folks! No one seems to have an explanation for what has happened, _____, do you have any thoughts as to what it could have been?

_____: Honestly it could be anything! Maybe aliens are real? Seems like we will never know!
