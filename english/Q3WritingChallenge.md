## Choice 3

Dear future me,

I'm hoping to read this when I graduate, if I can remember. I am writing this just before the 25 week mark of my junior year. I hope by the time you are reading this things are still going good, I'm feeling very good this year, and I hope everything is going even better now then it is at the time of me writing. Esports is going good this season, and by the time you read this, it will be our last season, Im hoping you will be able to find a coaching position for the team, I really enjoy it right now, and I hope Will is having fun with it too. I'm also hoping that everything with counseling is going good still, who knows, maybe I'll even be done by then! But I hope that that has been very beneficial to you, as I find it to be helpful. I'm also curious how you are feeling about college, because I'm sure that I've figured it out by then, but it feels like a big change with a lot to think about. I'm also curious about what your planning on going to college for, right now I'm thinking about computer science and programming, if that is still what I wanted to do, I hope I've worked on some more personal projects, at the time of me writing this, I still have a lot of work to do on my website, and haven't learned much Javascript, so Im hoping that I've invested mroe time into that then I have so far. I also hope everything is still going good with friends, its going well right now! I am also very curious as to what it's like having Will at baker, I'm hoping I end up having lunch or gym with him, we havent been at the same school for a bit, but I hope thats all been fun. Anyways, hope all is going well with you now, its going good right now!
