Dear future me,

I'm hoping to read this when I graduate, if I can remember. I am writing this just before the 25 week mark of my junior year. I hope by the time you are reading this things are still going good, I'm feeling very good this year, and I hope everything is going even better now then it is at the time of me writing. Esports is going good this season, and by the time you read this, it will be our last season, Im hoping you will be able to find a coaching position for the team, I really enjoy it right now, and I hope Will is having fun with it too. I'm also hoping that everything with counseling is going good still, who knows, maybe I'll even be done by then! But I hope that that has been very beneficial to you, as I find it to be helpful. I'm also curious how you are feeling about college, because I'm sure that I've figured it out by then, but it feels like a big change with a lot to think about. I'm also curious about what your planning on going to college for, right now I'm thinking about computer science and programming, if that is still what I wanted to do, I hope I've worked on some more personal projects, at the time of me writing this, I still have a lot of work to do on my website, and haven't learned much Javascript, so Im hoping that I've invested mroe time into that then I have so far. I also hope everything is still going good with friends, its going well right now! I am also very curious as to what it's like having Will at baker, I'm hoping I end up having lunch or gym with him, we havent been at the same school for a bit, but I hope thats all been fun. Anyways, hope all is going well with you now, its going good right now!

One of my favorite memories is something we do every year, but I always have vivid memories of what we do. Every year we go camping up to Westcott Beach State Park, as it has been a family tradition since before I was born, but we've gone every year except for 2020. Most of the swimming that we do is up at the beach at the camp, which I used to do a lot more before, but haven't gone swimming in a while. We also often go on the boat to get places while at camp, since the camp is in a somewhat large cove, so the waves are usually not bad enough to not be able to travel that way. Our aunt and uncle have their own camp house across the bay, so we'd often travel up there to take a break or grab my brother's medicine that needs refrigeration. Our trip up to Westcott is often one of the few times we see our whole extended family, as we all usually go together. Some of our family is from Massachusetts, so we don't see them much either, but it is always a good time to spend time with our family. Fishing is something we spend a lot of time doing while camping, my brother is really into fishing, and it's a great time to do it, sometimes we can fish in the marina, which is convenient, but does not have anything too amazing in terms of fish, but we often go up to Henderson harbor to fish, we don't usually get as many, but we get much bigger fish there. Last year we caught a 2 foot pike out near Henderson! Overall, Westcott often brings fond memories we spend with our family, from campfires to fishing, or just enjoying the weather!
