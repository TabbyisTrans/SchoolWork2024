# Tremores II

## Translation

Now the vehicle, which we had ordered to be brought out, although they were on flat ground, they were rolling in the opposite direction, even when propped up by rocks, they were still not staying still. Besides, we saw the sea being sucked back into itself, as if pushed back by the tremors. As the shore proceeded, many sea animals were left stranded on the dry sand. And from the other side a black and horrible cloud was gaping open and launching long shapes of flames, which were both similar to and greater than lightning. Then indeed that friend of our uncle urged us to try and flee. If your brother, if your uncle, lives, he wants your safety; if he died, I believe he wanted you all to be survivors; why are you hesitating? We responded that we cannot consider our safety while we are not certain about our Uncle. He cannot delay anymore, he turned himself around and fled.

Not much after, the black cloud descended to the ground; it covered the seas; it had concealed Capria, it had taken the view of the proventory of Misenium. Then my mother was begging, enouraging, and ordering, that we leave in any way; She affirmed that, because I'm young, I can arrive in safety; that because she is weighed down in both years and body, she would gladly die, if she had not been the cause of my death. I responded that I dont want to be safe unless she also had fled. And then I, having grasped the hand of her, I forced her to go foward. She obeyed unwillingly, and scolded herself, because she was delaying me.
