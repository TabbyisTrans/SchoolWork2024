# *The Aeneid* 1.12-18

## Translation

The very old city was (Tyrian colonists held it)

Carthage, Across from Italy at the mouth of the Tiber river far away,

rich in wealth and very fierce in its zeal for war,

which Juno is said to have charished it alone more than all other lands

with Samo held below. Her weapons were here,

here was her chariot, where she hopes a kingdom will be for her people,

if fate will allow it
