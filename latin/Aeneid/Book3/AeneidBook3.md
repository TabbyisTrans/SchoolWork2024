# Aeneid Book 3

## Translation

After the baots held the deep sea, and not no longer were any lands evident the sea was everywhere, then a dark storm cloud stood there above my head carrying darkness and storm, and a wake shrouded in darkness. Immediatly the wind set rolling the sea and great seas were built. We were scattered and thrown into a vast whirlpool. The clouds swallowed up the day and the rainy night snatched away the sky and the lightning doubled in the split clouds, we were shaken off the course, wandering through unseen waves. Palinurus himself said the he could not discern the day from the night, nore could he remember the way in the middle of the sea. For 3 whole days we wandered in the inpenetrable darkness on the sea, for the same number of nights without a star! On the fourth day the land seemed first to lift itself up finally, it seemed to reveal faroff mountains and roll away fog.
