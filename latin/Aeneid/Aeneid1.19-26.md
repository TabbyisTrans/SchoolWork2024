# *The Aeneid* 1.19-26

## Translation

But indeed she heard that offspring born from Trojan blood, which one day would overthrow Tyrian strongholds;

from which the people, ruling far and wide, and proud in war, to destroy Lybia;

thus she had heard the fates rolled it out; one day, Rome will destroy Carthage.

So Juno, fearing this, and mindful of the old war (Trojan War), which first she had waged at Troy on behalf of her dear Greeks.

Nor yet even then the causes of her anger and her savage sufferings, not even then had parished from her mind.
