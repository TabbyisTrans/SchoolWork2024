# Aeneid 1.26-33

## Translation

And first remain, stored in her mind,

the judgement of Paris, and the injury of her rejected beauty,

and the hated race (the trojans), and the honors of stolen Ganymede:

Juno, further enraged by these things, she was keeping far away from Latia, keeping the Trojans tossed around on the whole sea, the remnants of the Greeks and ruthless Achilles,

and the Trojans were driven by the fates around all the seas for many years,

so great a burden it was to found the Roman race.
