# Aeneid 1.1-11

## Translation

I sing of arms and the man, who was first exiled by fate from the shores of Troy, then came to the shores of Italy and Lavinian shores, that guy, thrown around a lot both on the lands and on the deep sea because of the force of the gods, on account of the mindful anger of savage Juno, having endured many things also in war, until he built a city in which he brings his gods to Latia; from which will come, the Latin race, and the ulben fathers and the walls of tall Rome. Muse, recall to me the causes, because of what divinity was harmed or what suffering queen of the gods drove the man distinguished by his piety to endure so many misfortunes and to endure so many labors. Are there such great angers in the minds of the gods.
