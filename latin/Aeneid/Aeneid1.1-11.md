# Aeneid 1.1-11

## Translation

I sing of arms and the man, who was first exiled by fate from the shores of Troy, then came to the shores of Italy and Lavinian shores, that guy, thrown around a lot both on the lands and on the deep sea because of the force of the gods, on account of the mindful anger of savage Juno, having endured many things also in war, until he built a city in which he brings his gods to Latia.
