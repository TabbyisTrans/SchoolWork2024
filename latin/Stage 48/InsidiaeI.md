> Emperor Nero plots to kill his mother

## Translation

But Nero, with his long reign, became bold, inflamed more and more for his love for Poppaeae, finally decided to kill his mother; he called together the ministers to consult whether he should use poison, a sword, or some other force (to kill his mother). At first the thought of poison pleased him. If at the feast of the emperor poison should be given, the death could not be attributed to misfortune, for a similar destruction Britanicus previously had perished; and also Aggripina herself had strengthened her body by taking a remedy in advance. No one was able to figure out how the violence and the murder might be hidden; and Nero was afraid that someone chosen for so great a crime might reject the orders.
