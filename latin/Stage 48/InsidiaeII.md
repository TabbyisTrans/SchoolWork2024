# Insidiae II

## Translation

The cleverness of Anicetus pleased Nero, moreover there was the best occasion of attempting the thing, now Nero is at Baiae to celebrate a festival day. He enticed his mother to come there; He went to meet her arriving on the journey; He recieved her hand and embrace; He led her to the house by the sea, named Bauli. A very decorated ship was standing near the house, as if for the purpose of honoring the mother of Aggripina; Aggripina was invited to the feast prepared at Baiae, so that the deed might be hidden by the night and the shadows. However, with the rumor having been heard through some betrayer, Aggripina at first was uncertain whether to believe it, finally she was driven to Baiae by a litter. There flatery removed her fear, having been recieved kindly, she was placed next to Nero at the dinner. Now Nero was carrying himself with youthful friendliness, at other times he was speaking seriously. Then, after the dinner prolonged for a long time, with many conversations, Nero followed Aggripina leaving, clinging with his eyes and his chest particularly closely, either for the purpose of putting the final touch to his pretending, or because the last sight of his mother, about to die, was restraining his savage soul.
