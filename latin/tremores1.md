# Tremores 1

## Translation

When I arrived, Uncle, I spent the remaining time studying (I had stayed behind); then I bathed, ate, and had a little bit of restless sleep. For many previous days, ground tremors were felt, it was less alarming, because it was common in Campania; but that night they became so strong, that everything seemed to not be moving, just toppling. Then my mother burst into the room, I was getting up myself, to wake her up if she was sleeping. We were sitting in the courtyard, which seperated the distance between the sea and the building; so that I might calm the fears of my mother, I demanded a book and began to read as if at leisure. Suddenly a friend of my uncle arrived, when he saw me and my mother sitting, me indeed even reading, scolded the patience of her and the lack of patience of me. Nevertheless I was intent to stay focused on my book. It was the first hour of the day, but there is no light. Now with the nearby buildings having been shaking, there was great and certain fear it would collapse. Then we finally decided to flee; for if we had delayed any longer, without a doubt we would have died. Having advanced beyond the buildings, we stopped for the purpose of breathing. We saw many strange things there, and we endured many terrors.
