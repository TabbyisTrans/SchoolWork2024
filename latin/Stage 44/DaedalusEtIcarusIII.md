# Daedalus & Icarus III

## Translation

He equipped his son with wings and he said "I warn you, Icarus, take the middle path so that the waves not weigh down your wings if you fly too low, and the fire does not burn them if you go too high. Fly between both! Do not watch The Herdsmen or the Great Bear, I order you to go towards the sword of Orion! Sieze the way with me as leader!" At the same time he handed over flying instructions and fit unnatural wings to his shoulders.
