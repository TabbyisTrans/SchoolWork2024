# Daedalus & Icarus IV

## Translation

During his work and his instructions, his cheeks became wet, and the hands of the father trembled. He gave kisses to his son nought to be repeated again, and lifted up on his feathers flies in front and fears for his son, like a bird, he brings out his tender offspring into the air from the high nest; he encouraged him to follow, he taught him the damned arts, and he himself moved his wings and looked back at his son. Someone saw them and was amazed, while he was trying to catch fish with a trempling rod, or a shepard leaning on his staff, or a plowman leaning on his plow. Whoever it was that they saw, they believed them to be gods.
