# Daedalus & Icarus V

## Translation

And now on the left side is Samos, sacred to jupiter (both Delos and Paros had been left behind), and on the right is Lebinthos and Calymne, rich with honey, when the boy began to rejoice in his bold flight, and he deserted the leader, and drawn on by desire of the sky, traveled too high.
