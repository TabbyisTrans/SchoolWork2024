# Daedalus & Icarus V

## Translation

And now on the left side is Samos, sacred to jupiter (both Delos and Paros had been left behind), and on the right is Lebinthos and Calymne, rich with honey, when the boy began to rejoice in his bold flight, and he deserted the leader, and drawn on by desire of the sky, traveled too high. The nearness of the blazing sunbegan to soften the sweet wax binding the feathers. The wax had melted; and he shook his bare arms and lacking wings, he didnt take hold of any air. His mouth, shouting the name of his father, was taken over by the dark blue water, which took the name from him.
