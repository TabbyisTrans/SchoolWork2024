# Daedalus and Icarus II

## Translation

Then he binds the middle feathers with thread and the bottom feathers with wax, and he bent them, having been put together in a small curve, so that he may immitate a real bird. Icarus was standing with him and, unknowing that he was handling his own dangers, sometimes with his face smiling, he was trying to catch the feathers in which were moved by the wind, he was softening the golden wax with his thumb, and he was impeding the strang work of his father with his play. After the final touch was placed on the undertaking, the craftsman balanced his body on the two wings, and hung in the moved air.
