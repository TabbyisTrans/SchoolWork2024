# Daedelus & Icarus

## Translation

Meanwhile Daedelus hating Crete and his long exile, and touched by love of the place of his birth, had been cut of by the sea. "Although Minos may block my way through these lands and the sea, but certainly the sky lies open; we will go that way! Minos may possess everything, but he does not possess the sky." he said, and sent his mind to unknown arts and changes nature. For he placed the feathers in order, so that you would think that they would have grown on a slope; as sometimes a rustic pipe rises little by little (resembles the pan pipe).
