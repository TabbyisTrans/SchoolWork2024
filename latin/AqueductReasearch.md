# Aqueduct Reasearch

## Uses

Provided water for the baths, personal sanitation, and provided for the mining, dyeing, and other industries. Most of the water that was used for farming came from aqueducts.
Aqueducts were often one of the largest contributing factors to local city economies and allowed for extremely low food prices and leisure for citizens.

## Design

* Designed with a 1:4800 gradient, extemely shallow so that water flows, but not so fast it could overflow easily

* tanks were used to store water at the bottom or in areas where a shallow gradient were not possible

* Tops typically covered with slabs, however they have since eroded away on most of them

* At the end in the city, water pools up in a resivoir and could be spread around through smaller aqueducts or using stopcocks to use pipes to transfer elsewhere.

* Aquedcuts were typically supported by one to two sets of arches to provide both elevation and structural reginity. Aqueducts could also be able to be walked under in cities.

* Aquecut conduits were typically built with concrete faced bricks.

* Aqueduct channels typically ran through mountains and large obstacles, much of the aqueduct system was underground.

## Downfall in use

As the empire began to get raided, the aqueducts were often stopped or cut off, as their empire declined, many were damaged or destroyed after being left unmaintained. And the invention of electricity and pumps later replaced the gravity powered aqueducts.
