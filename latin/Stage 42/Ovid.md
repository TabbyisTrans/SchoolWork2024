# Ovid

## Translation

If she does not accept the letter and sends it back undread, hope that she will read it and keep your resolve. In time the stubborn bull will come to the plow. In time horses are taught to endure the supple reins. The iron ring, is consumed by continual use. The curved plowshare wears away at the ground with continual contact. Because what is more harsh than a rock, and what is more soft than a wave. However hard rocks are hollowed out by soft water. Stand still, in time you will conquer even Penelope herself: after a long time you will see Troy captured, but captured nonetheless.

### Questions

1. Ovid tells the young man to essentialy keep trying to convince the girl to love him, he makes many analogies to farming, like how horses will learn to use a plow and talks about tools wearing down, but they dont prove anything about humans and love, I think its part satire and partialy to make the character look inteligent to the young man.

2. Pergama was a city in Greece, sero means at a late hour, Penelope was Odysseus' wife, and despite many men trying to convince her to marry them, she continued to wait for Odysseus to return.
