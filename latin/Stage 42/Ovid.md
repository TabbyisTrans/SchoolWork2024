# Ovid

## Translation

If she does not accept the letter and sends it back undread, hope that she will read it and keep your resolve. In time the stubborn bull will come to the plow. In time horses are taught to endure the supple reins. The iron ring, is consumed by continual use. The curved plowshare wears away at the ground with continual contact.
