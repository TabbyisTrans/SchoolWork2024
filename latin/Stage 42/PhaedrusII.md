# Phaedrus II

## Translation

Once in a meadow a frog caught sight of a cow, and having touched envy of such great size, she puffed up her wrinkled skin. Then she asked her children whether she was wider than the cow. They said no. Again she stretched her skin with great effort, and in a similar manner she asked who was bigger. They said the cow. She was extremely offended, while she wanted to inflate more strongly, she lied down with her body having been ruptured.
