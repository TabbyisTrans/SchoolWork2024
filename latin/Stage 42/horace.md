## Translation

Do not ask questions about what end the gods have planned for me, for you, it is forbidden knowledge. Luconoe, do not bother with astrology. It is better to endure what is to be, whether Jupiter grants many winters, or a final winter, which now weakens the Tyrrhenium sea with opposing cliffs: may you be wise, may you strain the wines, and in a short time, cut back long hope. While we are speaking, envious time wile have fled; sieze the day, trusting as little as possible of whats next.
