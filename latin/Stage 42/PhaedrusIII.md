# Phaedrus III

## Translation

When a dog was carrying meat swimming across the river, he saw his own reflection in the mirror of the water, and thinking that another prize was being carried by another dog, wanted to take it. But his greed was decieved and he lost the food that he was holding in his mouth, and that which he was seeking he was not able to have.
