# Phaedrus I

## Translation

A sheep and a wolf came to the same end of a stream driven by thirst; farther upstream lie the wolf, farther down lie the sheep. Then the wolf, driven by relentless hunger, made an argument. "why" said the wolf, "did you make the water dirty for me who is drinking?" The wooly one, in response, fearing, said: "how can I, I ask, do what you are complaining about, the water runs down from you to my drinking spot. He was taken back by the strength of the truth: "6 months ago you had spoken badly to me" he said "insulted you?" said the lamb. "I was not born 6 months ago." "By Hercules!" he said "you talk badly about me!" And he tore apart the seized animal in an unjust way.
