# Catullus II

## Translation

I am ariving at these miserable funeral rights. I having been traveled through many nations and trhough many seas, so that I can gift you with a final gift of death. And so I might talk to silent ashes in vain. Since fortune has stolen you from me, o alas miserable brother having been taken away from me unfairly. now however I recieve this ancient custom where I accept these things which have been handed over as a sad gift to the dead. And into eternity, brother, hail and farewell.
