# Callutus I

## Translation

Egnatus, because he had bright, gleaming white teeth, grins on every possible occasion. If people had come to the bench of the defendant, when the speaker stirs up tears, he still laughs; when people we mourning at the funeral pyre for the son, when the mother is mourning her only son, he is still laughing. Whatever is happening, whereever he is, whatever he is doing, he smiles: he has this ilness, neither elegant, nor refined, as I think. Therefore I must warn you, good Egnatius. If you were a man from Rome or Sabine or a man from Tibur or a plumb Umbrian our a fat Etruscan, or anyone at all, who washes their teeth with clean water, for nevertheless I would not want you to smile on any occasion: for there is nothing worse than a silly smile.
