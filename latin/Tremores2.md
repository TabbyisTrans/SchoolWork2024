# Tremores II

## Translation

Now the vehicle, which we had ordered to be brought out, although they were on flat ground, they were rolling in the opposite direction, even when propped up by rocks, they were still not staying still. Besides, we saw the sea being sucked back into itself, as if pushed back by the tremors. As the shore proceeded, many sea animals were left stranded on the dry sand. And from the other side a black and horrible cloud was gaping open and launching long shapes of flames, which were both similar and greater than lightning. If your brother, if your uncle, lives, he wants your safety; if he died, I believe he wanted you all to be survivors; why are you hesitating? We responded that we cannot consider our safety while we are not certain about our Uncle. He cannot delay anymore, he turned himself around and fled.

Not much after, the black cloud descended to the ground; it covered the sea; it had concealed Capria, it had taken the view of Misenium.
