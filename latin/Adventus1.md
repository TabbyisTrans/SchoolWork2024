## Translation

My journey, master, to Ephasus was very comfortable; afterwards, I began to make the journey on carriages, where I was afflicted by very serious heat. When I had gotten better, I got on the ship again, I was held back by strong opposing winds; therefore I entered Bythinia a little later than I had expected, on October 17th.

Now upon expecting the accounts of the people of Prusa, it seems more and more necessary to look. A lot of money is being spent from private accounts. Consider, master, whether you think it is necessary to send a Surveyor here for the purpose of inspecting the public works. I think that a lot of money is able to be recovered, to make sure the measurements are done well. I wrote this letter to you, master, as soon as I arrived.
