# The Metamorphoses

My soul carries me to speak about forms changing into new bodies; gods, inspire my begginings (for you also change forms) and these poemes tell from the first origin of the world to my times.

Inachus alone is absent and hidden in a deep cave, he increases the water by his weeping. He is very sad, he mourns his daughter Io as if she is dead. He wonders whether her daughter is enjoying life or is among the spirits of the dead; but he does not find her anywhere, he thinks that she is nowhere and fears the worst things in his soul.

## Jupiter and Io

Jupiter had seen her returning from her river father and he had said "'O maiden worthy of Jupiter, I dont who your about to make blessed because of your marriagement" he said, "seek shade of deep groves (and he had showed the shadow of the forest) while it is growing hotter, and the sun is highest in the sky! But if you are afraid to enter the hiding places of the beasts alone, you will pass into the secret places of the woods, safe with a god overlooking", "nor am I a god from the common people, but one who represents wields the scepter of the heavens above, I am the one who sends out wandering lightning. Dont run from me!" indeed she was fleeing. Now in a pasture in Lerna with trees planted on the arable land of Mt. Lyrecus, while the land was hidden by the dark fog spreading over it, the god grabbed her fleeing, and captured her with no decency.
