# Tenebrae

Now the ash was falling down, thus far it was rare. I looked back, a dense black cloud was right behind us, it was following us, as if a huge black river was pouring out of the ground. "lets turn off the road, " I said, "while we can still see, so we dont get trampled to death by a multitude of people fleeing." We could hardly stop, when the darkness descended, all of the light in a room had been put out. if you were present, you would have heard the shrieks of women, the wailing of babies, the shouts of men; some were searching for their parents with their vocices, and with their voices were being recognized, some were mourning their children, some were mourning their spouses, some were mourning their loss, some were mourning the loss of their family, some were praying for death because of the fear of death; some were raising their hands to the gods, more were declaring that nowhere now are there any gods.
