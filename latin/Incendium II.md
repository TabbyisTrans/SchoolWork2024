# Incendium II

## Translation

It has occured in my mind to establish a fire brigade among the Nicomedians, just as it has been done in the other provinces. But it is important for us to remember that other cities have been harassed by groups like this in the province. Whatever people we assemble for this group will soon become a political club. Whatever people are assembled for this will be helpful, therefore, we should get the things that will be helpful in putting out fires. You should also tell the masters of the properties that are having a fire they need to put it out, and if its too bad, they should ask for others help.

## Homework Questions

1. Trajan decides not to create a fire department.

2. Fire departments had typically formed political groups

3. Trajan encourages a fire pump be installed, and that property owners are to put out their own fires, or get help from neighbors if it's too serious.

4. I agree with it to a certain extent, I think they do need a fire department, but political groups are not a good thing to happen, but it shouldn't matter as a fire department is more important in my personal opinion.
