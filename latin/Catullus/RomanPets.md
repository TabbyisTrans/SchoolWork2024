## Translation

### Part A

The sparrow, delight of my girl, with whom she is accustomed to play, and with who she is accustomed to hold in her lap, whom she is accustomed to give her fingertip to the one pecking. And is accustomed to encourage more bites, whenever it is pleasing to my radiant sweetheart to play some sweet joke, even as a small comfort of her pain, I believe, so that then her grave anguish might die down. I wish I could play with you just like she does, and wish I could lighten the sad cares of her mind.
