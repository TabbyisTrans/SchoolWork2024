# Catullus II

## Translation

Let us live, my Lesbia, and let us love, let us value all the gossip of strict old men as one single coin.

The suns are able to fall and return: when once the brief light sets for us, one perpetual night must be slept by us.

Give to me a thousand kisses, then a hundred, the a thousand more, then a second hundred, then yet another thousand, the a hundred.
