# Catullus III

## Translation

Mourn, o gods and godesses of loving people! The sparrow of my girlfriend is dead, the sparrow of my darling girlfriend is dead, whom she was loving much more than her eyes. For he was sweet as honey and knew his miststress as well as a daughter to a mother, nor did he move from her lap, but hoping around here and there it was chirping continuosly to my mistress alone. The bird who now goes through the dark to that place from where they refuse to return. Curse you evil darkness from hell, who devour all beautiful things. Now you take away the beauty of the sparrow from me, oh dreadfully done! Oh miserable sparrow! Now by your doing my girlfriend because of crying has poor swollen red eyes.
