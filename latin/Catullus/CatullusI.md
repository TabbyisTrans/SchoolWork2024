# Catullus I

## Translation
 
That guy seems to me to be equal to a god, he, if it is right to say it, may surpass the gods, he is sitting across from you, repeadtedly listening to and seeing you laughing sweetly 

which takes all my senses from miserable me: For as soon as I saw you, Lesbia, nothing remains of my voice in my mouth.

my toung is paralyzed, a thin flame flows down under my limbs, and my ears are ringing with their own sound, my eyes are covered with a twin night
