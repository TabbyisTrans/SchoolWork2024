# Catullus I

## Translation

That guy seems to me to be equal to a god, he, if it is right to say it, may surpass the gods, he is sitting across from you, repeadtedly listening to and seeing you laughing sweetly

which takes all my senses from miserable me: For as soon as I saw you, Lesbia, nothing remains of my voice in my mouth.

my tongue is paralyzed, a thin flame flows down under my limbs, and my ears are ringing with their own sound, my eyes are covered with a twin night

Catullus, free time is annoying to you: you get excited in leisure and you become too restless: your leisure destroyed both beatiful kings and cities.
