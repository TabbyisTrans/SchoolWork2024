# Catullus V

## Translation

You used to say that Catullus was the only one you knew, Lesbia, and you used to say that you do not want to have jupiter instead of me. I loved you then not only as a common man loves his girlfriend, but as a father loves his sons and sons in law. But now I have gotten to know you, even if I'm burning more with passion for you, you are even more cheap and worthless to me. How is it possible, you ask because such an injustice forces a lover to love more, but to like less.
