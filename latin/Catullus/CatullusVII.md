# Catullus VII

## Translation

Miserable Catullus, stop being a fool,
and consider that thing which that you have seen die is totally lost.
Once the sun shined brightly for you,
when you used to go often where the girl is leading,
the girl who was loved by me as much as none will be loved.

Then when many fun things were happening,
which you wanted nor did the girl not not want,
Truly bright suns were shining for you.

Now the girl doesent want: you are weak, dont want her,
Dont follow her who flees, dont live miserably,
endure with a stuborn mind, be strong.
Goodbye, girl. Now Catullus is tough,
And he will not seek you
nor will he ask for the one thats unwilling.
